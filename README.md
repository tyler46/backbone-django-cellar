Django Backend for Backbone.js Wine Cellar tutorial
====================================================

On the great [tutorial](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-part-1-getting-started/)
from Christophe Coenraets about [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) there
are two RESTFull services in order to run backbone app, one is PHP based
and the other is Java based. 

So in this project is presented a Django/Python based RESTFull service
appproach by exploring the two major webservice API frameworks for Django.

* [Tastypie](http://tastypieapi.org)
* [Django REST framework](http://django-rest-framework.org)


Moreover Backbone application is splitted in modules rather than in a single file.
